        <h2>State of Mob justice in India</h2>
        <p>A Summary of the findings: </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Where:</b> From the reports in our database, <span class="highlight">maximum instances were reported from Uttar Pradesh, followed by New Delhi</span>, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Kerala. The fewest incidents were reported from Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh, Telangana and Nagaland.</p>
        <p>Roughly half the cases were reported from rural and urban areas each. Mob led instances of <span class="highlight">violence that were provoked by disputes and altercations were more likely to have occurred in urban areas</span>, while lynchings, vigilantism and rage related to suspicions of witchcraft and child lifting were more likely to be reported from rural areas.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of crime</b>: While a few of these incidents were the outcome of a mob keeping a watch, some appeared to be planned against the targeted victim. <span class="highlight">Roughly half, however, appeared to have been spontaneous developments.</span></p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and Order Capacity of the State</b>: <span class="highlight">Most of the incidents were reported from areas where the police to population ratio was below that of the UN Recommendation</span>, and the judge to population ratio was below average or bad. From what appears in the reports, the police intervened only in a few cases but where it did, the intervention seems to have prevented a death in many cases. </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Reasons:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Disputes and Altercations</u> emerged as the <span class="highlight">most common reason</span> why people were attacked and/ or lynched. Mobs often attacked the victim over past / ongoing disputes to petty arguments such as complaints of a product purchased, a cat entering a neighbour’s house, or arguments related to driving and road rage. Roughly half of these appeared to be spontaneous responses rather than planned. Urban areas were more likely to report this category of incidents versus rural areas, and maximum cases were reported from New Delhi as compared to other states and Union Territories. <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>Cow Protection</u>: Cow-related violence has been another reason for mob violence. Victims were often attacked on suspicion of cow slaughter when they were transporting cattle and/or skinning the carcasses of dead cows. <span class="highlight">Muslims formed a disproportionate segment of victims in this category.</span> <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>Murder / Death</u>: People were also attacked on allegations of murder as part of a retributive justice cycle. There were often no clear patterns here in terms of rural/urban, planned/spontaneous. <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>A note on “Others”</u>: The largest sub-category of reasons why mobs attacked the victim(s) in the “Others” category was suspicion of the victim being a thief, followed by the victim(s) being in a relationship with someone (inter-caste / inter-religion / out of choice). Other reasons included attacks on people who protested or complained against the harassment of women, who were members of a different political party, were suspected of kidnapping, allegedly sold drugs, demanded some rights, were on duty etc. </li>

        <h2>Mob justice due to Witch Hunting</h2>
        <p>While looking for cases around lynching and mob violence, we found a few cases that were provoked by allegations of witchcraft. (Disclaimer: We did not search for “witchcraft” and our data lies at the intersections of mob violence and witch-hunting, hence, the reports in this section are not exhaustive).</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters:</b> As <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/when-women-are-branded-as-witches-and-brutalised-witchcraft-violence-against-women-4789745/" target="_blank">Swati Parashar argues</a>, “a combination of superstitious beliefs, religious practices and patriarchal norms unleashes lifelong suffering on women accused of witchcraft, in many cases resulting in their murders and lynchings... <span class="highlight">These stories are mostly passed over; the accused goes unpunished.</span>”</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Where:</b> Most of these occurred in the eastern part of the country with roughly half being reported from <span class="highlight">Jharkhand</span>. Most were reported from rural areas.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and Order Situation:</b> Most of the states from where these incidents were reported had below average ratio of judges to population; their police to population ratio is below the UN recommendation of 230 per lakh people. <span class="highlight">The police intervened only in a few cases in our database but where it did, the intervention seems to have saved lives.</span></p>
        <p><b class="larger">What the NCRB Data says:</b> Jharkhand, which had the largest share of reported incidents of mob violence instigated by allegations of witchcraft in our database also records the maximum cases of murder due to witchcraft according to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jharkhand-tops-in-witch-hunt-murders-rajasthan-ranks-low/" target="_blank">National Crime Records Bureau statistics</a>.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Who are the victims:</b> While the reports in our search had roughly half men and women as victims (women being slightly more), <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/when-women-are-branded-as-witches-and-brutalised-witchcraft-violence-against-women-4789745/" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">women often form a disproportionate share of the victims</span></a>. Roughly half of the affected people in our database were from the tribal communities.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of crime:</b> <span class="highlight">Many of these cases were planned.</span> People were frequently targeted if there had been a series of deaths, or if someone had developed an incurable illness. Decisions to lynch were often taken at the level of the community.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Read More: For example, two women were lynched in Jharkhand because they were held responsible for two deaths that occurred in Bengaluru, Karnataka: (<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jharkhand-two-women-lynched-to-death-following-allegations-of-practicing-witchcraft-2962078/" target="_blank">From an August 8, 2016 report</a>): </p>
          <i>“Ram Pravesh, a resident of Sahiyara tola, had lost his son about a month ago. His son had gone to Bengaluru to take up some odd jobs. Three days ago, Ram Pravesh’s son-in-law, who too was in Bengaluru, died due to some reason. He and another associate began suspecting the two women of practicing witchcraft and to deal with the problem the villagers called a meeting on Sunday.”</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b class="larger">Witchcraft as cover-up:</b> <span class="highlight">At least half of these appeared to be hate motivated crimes</span>. Some reports that dug deeper found that witchcraft accusations often covered up for something else, dispute over land being one important concern. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Read More: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jharkhand-witchhunt-property-disputes-personal-rivalries-triggered-assault-say-victims-kin/" target="_blank">From an August 10, 2015 report</a>:</p>
          <i>However, it was learnt that behind the garb of superstition lay property dispute, family and personal rivalries. Rakiya’s son Johan said, “Our relatives Sachin and Sandeep had an eye on our land. They led the mob that dragged my mother and sister out and stripped them.”</i>

        <h2>Mob justice due to Cow Vigilantism</h2>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters:</b> As reports in our database show, mobs attack people for different reasons, and cow protection is one of them. However, this is the category that has seen a <span class="highlight">surge since 2014</span>, and has been receiving much public attention.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Where:</b> Such incidents seem to be a <span class="highlight">nation-wide phenomenon</span> were reported from seventeen different states and UTs of the country with Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and Haryana reporting more incidents than others. Roughly half the cases were reported from rural and urban areas each, with slightly more incidents from the rural.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and Order:</b> Most of the states from where such incidents were reported had a police to population ratio below the UN recommended standards, and poor judge to population ratio. <span class="highlight">The police intervened in some cases but where it did, it was able to prevent a death in most cases.</span>   </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Hate Crime:</b> Most of these incidents appeared to be <span class="highlight">hate crimes with Muslims being the targets in most cases.</span> </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of Crime:</b> Only a few cases were spontaneous and <span class="highlight">roughly half were the fallout of</span> the mob, mostly members of “Gau Raksha” <span class="highlight">groups keeping a neighbourhood watch</span> for potential cow “smugglers” and/or “slaughterers”. Victims were often attacked on suspicion of carrying beef</p>

          <i>43-year-old Mohammed Hussain said he and his 38-year-old wife Naseema Bano were on way to their hometown in Harda after visiting an ailing relative in Hyderabad, when they were assaulted. “They pushed my wife around when she objected to our luggage being searched. We live in India and know what is wrong and right, we eat only goat meat. Besides, the black bag from which the meat was seized did not belong to us. Finally, a constable came to our rescue and saved my wife,” said Hussain.</i>

          <i>“ According to police, after the cow died following electrocution, its owner, a farmer, engaged the two Dalits, who were brothers, for skinning the animal before it was buried last night. On getting to know of the skinning, the “gau rakshaks” (cow vigilantes) went to the place and beat up the duo, identified as Mokati Elisha and Lazer, suspecting that they had killed the animal.”</i>

        <p><span class="highlight">Some lynchings are neither motivated by hate nor politics.</span> These are a result of people getting into arguments and letting anger take over their better selves. </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters</b>:  Most such incidents were spontaneous and reported from urban areas.

        <p><b class="larger">Reasons</b>: Most such incidents begin with: road rage, customers complaining over products and services, neighbours fighting over pets, victims objecting to sexual harassment and illegalities, etc. </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Missing policemen</b>: In most instances of lynchings related disputes and altercations, the <span class="highlight">local police did not intervene</span> often leading to the death of the victim.</p>
