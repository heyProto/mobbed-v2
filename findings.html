        <h3>State of Mob justice in India</h3>
        <p>A Summary of the findings: </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Geographical spread:</b> Uttar Pradesh accounts for the maximum instances of mob violence, followed by New Delhi, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Kerala. On the other hand, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh, Telangana and Nagaland witness the fewest number of incidents.</p>
        <p>Roughly half the cases were reported from rural and urban areas, but there is a difference: mob-led violence provoked by disputes and altercations were more likely to have occurred in urban areas, whereas incidents related to suspicions of witchcraft and child-lifting were more likely to be reported from rural areas</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of crime:</b> While a few of these incidents (0-20% of the time) were the outcome of a mob deliberately keeping a watch for a ‘crime’ to unfold, some others (21-40%) appeared to have been the result of a planned conspiracy against the victim. In roughly half the cases, however, the violence seems to have been spontaneous.
        </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and order capacity of the state:</b> Most (81—100% of the time) of the incidents were reported from areas where the police-to-population ratio was below that of levels recommended by the UN, and the judge-to-population ratio was below average. The data also bears out another pattern: the police and police intervened only in a few cases (0-20%) but where it did, the intervention seems to have prevented death.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it happened:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Disputes and Altercations</u>: emerged as the most common reason why people were attacked and/or lynched. Often, victims were attacked by mobs over an ongoing or past dispute that had not been resolved. These included petty causes such as an objection to the purchase of a product, a cat entering a neighbour’s house and fights that erupted over driving and road rage. Roughly half of these appeared to be spontaneous rather than planned. Two other patterns emerge from the data: urban areas were more likely to report this category of incident, and a maximum number of cases were reported from New Delhi as compared to other states and Union Territories. 
          <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>Cow Protection</u>: often, victims were attacked for reasons related to the possession or transportation of cows, or on suspicions of cow slaughter. Other times they were attacked while skinning the carcasses of dead cows. Muslims account for a disproportionate segment of victims in this category. 
          <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>Murder/Death</u>: people were also attacked on allegations of murder as part of a retributive justice cycle. In these cases, there are often no clear patterns in terms of a rural/urban spread or whether they were planned, or spontaneous acts. 
          <br/><br/> </li>
          <li><u>A note on “Others”</u>:  The largest sub-category of reasons why mobs attacked the victim(s) in the “Others” category relates to suspicions of victims being thieves. ‘Others’ also includes instances where victim(s) were/are in a relationship with people from other communities (caste and religion). This category also includes cases where people were attacked after they protested or complained against the harassment of women. Other instances include suspected kidnapping, drug dealing, etc.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="answer axios" id="witch-hunting">
        <h3>Mob justice due to Witch Hunting</h3>
        <p>The data reveals a few cases that were provoked by allegations of witchcraft. (Disclaimer: We did not search for “witchcraft” and our data lies at the intersections of mob violence and witch-hunting, hence, the reports in this section are not exhaustive).</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters:</b> As Swati Parashar argues, “a combination of superstitious beliefs, religious practices and patriarchal norms unleashes lifelong suffering on women accused of witchcraft, in many cases resulting in their murders and lynchings... These stories are mostly passed over; the accused goes unpunished.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Where:</b> Most of these occurred in the eastern part of the country with roughly half being reported from Jharkhand. Most were reported from rural areas.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and order:</b> Most of the states accounting for such incidents have a poor judge-to-population ratio, and often even the police-to-population ratio is below the UN recommendation of 230 per lakh people. The police intervened only in a few cases in our database but where it did, the intervention seems to have saved lives.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">What the NCRB Data says:</b> Jharkhand, which accounts for the largest share of reported incidents of mob violence instigated by allegations of witchcraft, also records the maximum cases of murder due to witchcraft as reflected in data collected by the National Crime Records Bureau.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Who are the victims:</b> Roughly half the victims in the data are/were from tribal communities.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of crime:</b> Many of these cases were planned. Frequently, people were targeted if there had been a series of deaths, or if someone had developed an incurable illness. Decisions to lynch were often taken at the level of the community.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Read More: For example, two women were lynched in Jharkhand because they were held responsible for two deaths that occurred in Bengaluru, Karnataka:(<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jharkhand-two-women-lynched-to-death-following-allegations-of-practicing-witchcraft-2962078/" target="_blank">From an August 8, 2016 report</a>): </p>
          <i>“Ram Pravesh, a resident of Sahiyara tola, had lost his son about a month ago. His son had gone to Bengaluru to take up some odd jobs. Three days ago, Ram Pravesh’s son-in-law, who too was in Bengaluru, died due to some reason. He and another associate began suspecting the two women of practicing witchcraft and to deal with the problem the villagers called a meeting on Sunday.”</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b class="larger">Witchcraft as cover-up:</b> At least half of these instances appeared to be motivated by hate. Some reports found that accusations of witchcraft were made as a cover for something else, such as land disputes.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Read More: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jharkhand-witchhunt-property-disputes-personal-rivalries-triggered-assault-say-victims-kin/" target="_blank">From an August 10, 2015 report</a>:</p>
          <i>"However, it was learnt that behind the garb of superstition lay property dispute, family and personal rivalries. Rakiya’s son Johan said, “Our relatives Sachin and Sandeep had an eye on our land. They led the mob that dragged my mother and sister out and stripped them.”</i>

      <div class="answer axios" id="cow-vigilantism">
        <h3>Mob justice due to Cow Vigilantism</h3>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters:</b> The reports in the data show that mobs attack people for different reasons, and ‘cow protection’ is one of them. However, cases under this category have surged since 2014, and have received much public attention.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Where:</b> Violence related to cows appears to be a nation-wide phenomenon. Instances were reported from seventeen different states and UTs with Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and Haryana reporting more incidents than others. Roughly half the cases were reported from rural and urban areas each, with slightly more incidents in rural India.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Law and Order:</b> Most of the states where such incidents were reported have a police-to-population ratio below that of UN recommended standards, and a poor judge-to-population ratio. The police intervened in some cases, and where it did, it was able to prevent a death in most cases.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Hate Crime:</b> Most of these incidents appeared to be hate crimes with Muslims being the targets in most cases.</span> </p>
        <p><b class="larger">Nature of Crime:</b> Only a few cases were spontaneous and roughly half were the fallout of the mob — mostly members of “Gau Raksha” groups — keeping a neighbourhood watch for potential cow “smugglers” and/or “slaughterers”. Victims were often attacked on suspicions of carrying beef.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Read More - <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/muslim-couple-on-train-beaten-in-mpbags-searched-over-beef-suspicion/" target="_blank">From a report of January 15, 2016</a></p>
          <i>43-year-old Mohammed Hussain said he and his 38-year-old wife Naseema Bano were on way to their hometown in Harda after visiting an ailing relative in Hyderabad, when they were assaulted. “They pushed my wife around when she objected to our luggage being searched. We live in India and know what is wrong and right, we eat only goat meat. Besides, the black bag from which the meat was seized did not belong to us. Finally, a constable came to our rescue and saved my wife,” said Hussain.</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Victims were often attacked when they were skinning the carcass of a dead cow.</p>

          <i>“According to police, after the cow died following electrocution, its owner, a farmer, engaged the two Dalits, who were brothers, for skinning the animal before it was buried last night. On getting to know of the skinning, the “gau rakshaks” (cow vigilantes) went to the place and beat up the duo, identified as Mokati Elisha and Lazer, suspecting that they had killed the animal.”</i>

        <h3>Mob justice due to Altercations and Disputes</h3>
        <p>Some lynchings appear to be motivated neither by hate nor politics. These are a result of extreme anger following arguments.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Why it matters</b>:  Most such incidents were spontaneous and reported from urban areas. In fact, most such incidents were reported from Delhi--which has a good police-and lower judge-to-population ratio--followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Reasons</b>: Most such incidents begin with road rage, customers complaining over products and services, neighbours fighting over pets, victims objecting to sexual harassment and illegalities, etc.</p>
        <p><b class="larger">Missing policemen</b>: In most instances of lynchings related disputes and altercations, the local police did not intervene, often leading to the death of the victim.</p>
